## Figure R7
The energy landscape of the product states at $V/\Delta_{\ell} \approx 2$ (the resonance condition for $L=2$ bubbles).
Each blue dot in the landscape represents a manifold of product states, grouped by their Hamming distance from the
$|\mathrm{N\acute{e}el}\rangle$ state and their relative static energy $E/V$.
The area of each dot is proportional to the occupation probability of the state manifold at different times $t$ after a quench
($\Omega/2\pi = 1.8\,\mathrm{MHz}$).

## Figure R8
Similar to Figure R7, but the Rabi frequency $\Omega$ is slowly ramped up in $1\,\mu\mathrm{s}$.
