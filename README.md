Figure R7: The energy landscape of the product states at $V/\Delta_l \approx 2$ (the resonance condition for $L=2$ bubbles). Each blue dot in the landscape represents a manifold of product states, grouped by their Hamming distance from the $|\text{Néel}\rangle$ state and their relative static energy $E/V$. The area of each dot is proportional to the occupation probability of the state manifold at different times $t$ after a quench ($\Omega/2\pi = 1.8\,\mathrm{MHz}$).

Figure R8: Similar to Figure R7, but the Rabi frequency $\mathrm{\Omega}$ is slowly ramped up in $1\,\mu\mathrm{s}$.
